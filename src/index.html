    <h3>An excercise project</h3>
    <p> This was an exercise project at Turku University software engineering class. I have very limited experience with html, css or javascript but I think this turned out nicely. </p>

    <h3>Original requirements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scrolling text</li>
      <li>Some effect (this is using <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/tweens">Tweens</a> to fade out the dead cells)</li>
      <li>Music - <a href="http://ericskiff.com/music/">Eric Skiff - Underclocked (underunderclocked mix)</a/></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>This simulation uses classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> rules. Additionally, if there are less than 15 new cells born in a generation a counter is incremented and game resets after certain amount is reached. This prevents some cases where it gets stuck oscillating some uninteresting small formations.</p>
    <p>Sliders above are used to control a particle effect when a cell dies. I did some experimenting but I did not like it too much. However I left it there so feel free to test. Also source code is <a href="">here (not yet though)</a>.</p>
